## Project Overview
The purpose of the project was to use data from New York City's Citi Bike program and see if it would be possible to recreate the program in De Moines, Iowa. In order to complete this analysis, we have used Python's pandas library to clean up the data and then created visualizations of that data using Tableau. Tableau provides the tool to create powerful analytic dashboards and tell a clear story that can be easily shared with others. Tableau can be simple, requiring little-to-no-coding, or quite complex, requiring some experience to write custom code in so-called calculated field. For this project I am using:

- Tableau to create visualizations, dashboard and story.
- Pandas to convert integer to a datetime datatype.
